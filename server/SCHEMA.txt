This is a text file to represent my database schema, since it is stored on a postgreSQL server attached to my 
Heroku backend, so the text is not directly accessible - I edit it through the command line.

CREATE TABLE users (
    id serial,
    username varchar NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    password varchar NOT NULL,
    notifications boolean
);

CREATE TABLE teams (
    id serial,
    name varchar NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE events (
    id serial,
    title varchar NOT NULL,
    date date NOT NULL,
    team varchar,
    CONSTRAINT fk_team FOREIGN KEY(team) REFERENCES teams(name) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (title, date, team)
);

CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
    id serial,
    username varchar,
    team varchar,
    CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY(username) REFERENCES users(username) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_team FOREIGN KEY(team) REFERENCES teams(name) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (username, team)
);
